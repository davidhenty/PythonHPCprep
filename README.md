# Make your Python code 10,000 times faster with parallel numpy!

[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This page details the setup steps you need to take in advance of the
RSECon22 workshop [Make your Python code 10,000 times faster with
parallel
numpy!](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/3101/submission/103)
on Wednesday 7th September 2022, 09:00 - 12:30 BST.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows
operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have
administrative privileges on.

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

The course assumes a basic understanding of Python programming. You
will also need to be able to run a Jupyter notebook on your own laptop
-- follow the installation instructions at
[https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install).

You will also need an account on the [UK national supercomputer
ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/); full details of how to apply
will be supplied in advance.

<h3>Timetable (all times are in BST)</h3>

<p><blockquote>This is still a draft workshop page and the material
below comes from previous courses on similar topics. It will be fully
updated in time for this workshop, but is made available here for
reference.</blockquote></p>

<h3>Lecture Material</h3>

<h4>Traffic Model</h4>

Based on this existing lecture:

 * [https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/1_bi1jjb9w](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/1_bi1jjb9w)

<h4>Introduction to Numpy Arrays</h4>

Based on this existing material:

  * [https://youtu.be/_7lnaD_CfEI?t=6507](https://youtu.be/_7lnaD_CfEI?t=6507)

<h4>Message-Passing Concepts</h4>

Based on these existing lectures:

 * [https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_c412efsc](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_c412efsc)
 * [https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_lflgoo4i](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_lflgoo4i)
 * [https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_fwdboeov](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_fwdboeov)

<h4>Basic MPI with mpi4py</h4>

Based on this existing lecture but converted to Python (currently
only covers C and Fortran - all routines are basically the same but
have a more elegant syntax in Python)

 * [https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_c21vap59](https://media.ed.ac.uk/id/0_c21vap59)

<h3>Exercise Material</h3>

Sample solutions at:

  * [https://github.com/EPCCed/EPCC-Exercises/tree/main/Traffic/](https://github.com/EPCCed/EPCC-Exercises/tree/main/Traffic/)

We will concentrate on the Python solutions but C and Fortran versions
are also supplied for performance comparison.

Exercise sheet will be a modified and cut-down version of:

  * [Exercises](exercises/ihpcss2022-exercises.pdf)

A much as possible, these exercises will be made available to
attendees via a Jupyter notebook.
